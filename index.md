### Description

This navigation calculator has a simple but functional and intuitive design, and allow you to solve a bundle of the most common navigation problems:
- Conversion between different unit systems for distance, height, speed, time, pressure, temperature and so on
- Solving several geodetic problems such as both direct and inverse problem, finding of magnetic variation for specific location, calculating coordinates of intersection point for two given radials, and funny but useful task of defining the distane to horizon for given spectator's height
- Flight tasks including calculation of wind triangle, wind components (crosswind and headwind), holding pattern details, and parameters of turn
- Calculation of atmosphere-related characteristics for specific altitude such as ISA values, true airspeed given indicated airspeed, transfering from QFE to QNH and vice versa, and defining of required temperature correction for barometric altimeter
- Providing you with various help information about aircrafts, airlines and airports, reference information regarding phonetic aviation alphabet along with Morse code, a very useful handbook of aviation abbreviations and acronyms, and a calendar to obtain information about upcoming AIRAC cycle dates
