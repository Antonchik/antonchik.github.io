## Terms of Service Agreement

This Terms of Service Agreement ("Agreement") is between you ("User" or "you") and Pilotiq ("Pilotiq," "we," "our" or "us"), the developer of the Pilotiq mobile application (the "App") for iOS and Android platforms. By downloading and using the App, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to these terms, you should not use the App.

### Use of the App

Pilotiq grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use. You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer or sell any information, software, products, or services obtained from the App.

### Subscription and Payment

The App offers a monthly auto-renewal subscription ("Subscription"). By purchasing the Subscription, you agree to pay the subscription fee and any applicable taxes, and authorize Pilotiq to charge your designated payment method on a recurring monthly basis until you cancel your Subscription. Pilotiq reserves the right to change the Subscription fee at any time. If we do change the fee, we will notify you before the change takes effect, and you will have the option to cancel your Subscription.

### Auto-renewal and Cancellation

Your Subscription will automatically renew each month, and your designated payment method will be charged the then-current Subscription fee, unless you cancel your Subscription before the next billing cycle. You may cancel your Subscription at any time by going to your device's App Store or Google Play Store account settings and canceling the Subscription. Pilotiq does not offer refunds for any unused portion of a Subscription.

### Privacy Policy

Pilotiq respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. By using the App, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

### Intellectual Property

The App, its content, and all intellectual property rights in the App and its content are owned by Pilotiq or its licensors. You may not use any trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names or any other proprietary designations of Pilotiq or its affiliates without our express written consent.

### Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. Pilotiq does not warrant that the App will be error-free or uninterrupted, that defects will be corrected, or that the App or the server that makes it available are free of viruses or other harmful components.

### Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Pilotiq be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the App or its use, even if Pilotiq has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

### Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Pilotiq is based, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.

### Modification of Agreement

Pilotiq reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time. If we make any material changes to this Agreement, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice in the App. Your continued use of the App following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

### Termination

Pilotiq may terminate this Agreement and your access to the App at any time, without notice, for any reason or no reason.

### Entire Agreement

These terms of service constitute the entire agreement between the user and Pilotiq with respect to the use of the Pilotiq application and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between the user and Pilotiq.
